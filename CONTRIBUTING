If you find any issues with the bot, please make an issue explaining in as much detail as you can what the issue is. Feature requests can be made too. Pull requests can be made for any new feature, improvement or issue fix you decide. If you have the code, or part of the code, for something but don't want to make a pull request you can just make it an issue instead.
